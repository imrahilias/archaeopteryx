# Below are the color init strings for the basic file types. A color init
# string consists of one or more of the following numeric codes:
# Attribute codes:
# 00=none 01=bold 04=underscore 05=blink 07=reverse 08=concealed
# Text color codes:
# 30=black 31=red 32=green 33=yellow 34=blue 35=magenta 36=cyan 37=white
# Background color codes:
# 40=black 41=red 42=green 43=yellow 44=blue 45=magenta 46=cyan 47=white
NORMAL 00 # no color code at all
FILE 00 # regular file: use no color at all
RESET 0 # reset to "normal" color
DIR 94 # directory
LINK 36 # symbolic link. (If you set this to 'target' instead of a
 # numerical value, the color is as for the file pointed to.)
MULTIHARDLINK 00 # regular file with more than one link
FIFO 33,47 # pipe
SOCK 01;35;47 # socket
DOOR 35;47 # door
BLK 32;47 # block device driver      
CHR 01;32;47 # character device driver
ORPHAN 01;30;41 # symlink to nonexistent file, or non-stat'able file
SETUID 01;31;47 # file that is setuid (u+s)
SETGID 31;47 # file that is setgid (g+s)
CAPABILITY 34;47 # file with capability
STICKY_OTHER_WRITABLE 01;30;104 # dir that is sticky and other-writable (+t,o+w)
OTHER_WRITABLE 94 # dir that is other-writable (o+w) and not sticky
STICKY 01;34 # dir with the sticky bit set (+t) and not other-writable
# This is for files with execute permission:
 EXEC 0
# List any file extensions like '.gz' or '.tar' that you would like ls
# to colorize below. Put the extension, a space, and the color init string.
# (and any comments you want to add after a '#')
# If you use DOS-style suffixes, you may want to uncomment the following:
#.cmd 01;32 # executables (bright green)
#.exe 01;32
#.com 01;32
#.btm 01;32
#.bat 01;32
# Or if you want to colorize scripts even if they do not have the
# executable bit actually set.
#.sh 01;32
#.csh 01;32
# archives or compressed (bright red)
