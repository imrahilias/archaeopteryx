# revert a pacman update as a whole.

# suppose you didnt use your machine for a few weeks. casually you'd
# update everything via `sudo pacman -Syyu`, reboot and: nothing
# works. the update upgraded say 256 packages, at least one of them
# causing somethin to break. The easiest thing would be to revert the
# whole last update,and thats exactly what this script does.
